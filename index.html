                    James Gosling, born on May 19, 1955, in Alberta, Canada, is recognized worldwide as the Father of Java. 
                    His innovative work at Sun Microsystems in the 1990s led to the creation of the Java programming language, 
                    which revolutionized the way software applications were developed.
                    <br><br>
                    Gosling earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary and later his Ph.D. in Computer Science 
                    from Carnegie Mellon University. During his career, he made significant contributions to distributed systems, 
                    virtual machines, and compiler design. Java's philosophy of "write once, run anywhere" made it an essential 
                    tool for developers worldwide.
